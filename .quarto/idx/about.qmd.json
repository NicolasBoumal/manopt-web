Heidel](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=248082) contributed a factory for tensors of fixed multilinear rank in Tucker format: [`fixedranktensorembeddedfactory`](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/manifolds/fixedranktensors/fixedranktensorembeddedfactory.m).\n\n[Estelle Massart](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=F_xNQ7IAAAAJ) contributed code to [`symfixedrankYYfactory`](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/manifolds/symfixedrank/symfixedrankYYfactory.m).\n\n[Ronny Bergmann](https://ronnybergmann.net/) contributed code to [`multinomialfactory`](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/manifolds/multinomial/multinomialfactory.m).\n\n[Michael Psenka](https://www.michaelpsenka.io/) contributed the code for optimization over tensors with fixed tensor-train rank, accessible through [`fixedTTrankfactory`](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/tree/master/manopt/manifolds/ttfixedrank), together with an [example script](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/examples/low_rank_tensor_completion_TT.m).\nThis geometry heavily relies on [TTeMPS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/anchp/index-html/software/ttemps/) for all core functionalities except second-order optimization (specifically, M.ehess2rhess).\nTTeMPS is code distributed by [Michael Steinlechner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_15-1MAAAAJ&hl=nl), [Daniel Kressner](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/anchp/) and [Bart Vandereycken](https://www.unige.ch/math/vandereycken/).\nWe thank them for releasing their excellent software under an open source license, which allowed us to build upon it.\nIt is packaged in Manopt with small modifications.\n\n[Quentin Rebjock](https://people.epfl.ch/quentin.rebjock?lang=en) contributed [`poincareballfactory`](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/manifolds/hyperbolic/poincareballfactory.m) and more.\n\n[Xiaowen Jiang](https://github.com/Xiaowen-Jiang) worked in the group of Nicolas during the summer of 2021 to add support for [automatic differentiation](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/tree/master/manopt/autodiff), based on [Matlab's Deep Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html).\nThis fantastic feature aligns well with Manopt's overarching goal: to lower the entrance barrier for people who would like to give Riemannian optimization a try.\nIt is available via `manoptAD`.\nThanks a lot, Xiaowen!\n\n[Niklas Koep](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CpQ1YvMAAAAJ&hl=en) (sinxoverx), [Nick Vannieuwenhoven](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oVFJK2MAAAAJ&hl=en) (Storey-Liu for CG), [Spencer Kraisler](https://mathoverflow.net/users/141449/spencer-kraisler) (Rodrigues formula, Lie identity), [sfrcorne](https://github.com/sfrcorne) (rlbfgs invariant to positive scaling) brought welcome improvements after discussions on the github repo page.\n\n[Victor Liao](https://victorliao.com/) worked on Manopt in the group of Nicolas during the summer of 2022 and contributed: a long-awaited refactoring of the trustregions solver to allow for various subproblem solvers, a rewrite of the truncated CG (tCG) subproblem solver to improve performance by recycling computations after a step rejection, a new global subproblem solver based on code by [Yuji Nakatsukasa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao3aPU0AAAAJ&hl=en), a constant step-size line-search helper for gradient methods, and various improvements (e.g., to `tangentorthobasis`).\n\nBelow are some third-party open-source codes that are or were used at some point:\n\n*   The `multitransp` / `multiprod` pair is code by [Paolo de Leva](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8773-multiple-matrix-multiplications-with-array-expansion-enabled) (no longer used: `multiprod` now calls [pagemtimes](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pagemtimes.html));\n*   `multitrace` is a wrapper around `diagsum`, which is code by [Wynton Moore](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10062-multi-dimensional-matrix-product-outer-product-and-partial-trace) ;\n*   The `hashmd5` tool is a stripped version of more general hashing code (no longer available) by Michael Kleder. It is no longer used.\n\n\n\n\n## How to contribute\n\nPlease [send a pull request on github](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/pulls) for all contributions, big and small.\n\nManopt is meant to ease the sharing of geometries and solvers.\nIf you developed a Riemannian geometry, a solver or some other tool for optimization on manifolds and would like it to be featured in Manopt, \n\nYou should include:\n\n* An implementation of your manifold / solver / tool in the Manopt format.\n* An example script to illustrate its features.\n* Ample in-code documentation.\n\nWe will gladly help: discussions can take place along your PR on github or prior to that on the [forum](forum.qmd).\n\nThe documentation page as well as the code will, of course, visibly reflect the authors of the contribution as well as relevant publications.\n\nContributors agree to the terms of the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.txt).\nThis agreement protects you as a contributor by making it clear that you retain your right to use your own contributions for any other purpose (you retain the copyrights).\nThis agreement protects us as maintainers by authorizing us to distribute the toolbox under a unified license.\n\n\n## License\n\nManopt, a Matlab toolbox for optimization on manifolds, is copyright by Nicolas Boumal and is distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 (or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
