## General idea ![](images/icon_salute.gif)

At first sight, optimization on manifolds is restricted to optimization problems on smooth sets.
Notwithstanding, we can use smooth parameterizations of (possibly) nonsmooth sets to extend the realm of applications.

Consider the following commutative diagram.

![Commutative diagram on which lifts are based.](images/lift_diagram_EMN.png){width=25em}

The principal objects in this diagram are in black.
They are as follows:

* $\calM$ is a Riemannian manifold.
* $\calN$ is a Riemannian manifold too (often, it is a Euclidean space).
* $f \colon \calN \to \reals$ is the cost function we wish to minimize *on some subset*.
* $\varphi \colon \calM \to \calN$ is the *lift* or *parameterization*: its image $\calX = \varphi(\calM)$ is a subset of $\calN$.
* $g = f \circ \varphi \colon \calM \to \reals$ is the function we will actually minimize (without restriction on $\calM$).

Notice that by minimizing $g$ on $\calM$, we are effectively minimizing $f$ on $\calX$, because $g(y) = f(\varphi(y))$ so that we only ever evaluate $f$ at points of the form $x = \varphi(y)$ which, by definition, are in $\calX$.

Moreover, if $f$ and $\varphi$ are both smooth, then so is $f$ by composition.

This means that even if $\calX$ is a nonsmooth set, we can still use Manopt to (try to) minimize $f$ on $\calX \subset \calN$.

We can do this explicitly by constructing a `problem` structure for $g$ on $\calM$.
Alternatively, we can construct a problem structure for $f$ on $\calN$ and compose it with $\varphi$ by using `manoptlift`.
To do so, this tool requires some information about $\varphi$ and its derivatives: this is all stored in a `lift` structure.
Manopt comes with some built-in lifts (see below), and users can create their own.


## Available lifts

The following lifts are available in Manopt:

* 
* 
* 

They can be used to optimize over several nonsmooth sets, as listed in the next few sections with further explanations.

## Hadamard (entrywise product)

## Burer-Monteiro for smooth SDP

## Burer-Monteiro for general bounded-rank

## Boxes

## Balls


## What is in a lift structure

## Side comments

The `desingularizationfactory` encode the geometry of a Riemannian manifold, but `egrad2rgrad` and `ehess2rhess` in that factory actually correspond to a lift, as described in the documentation of the factory.
