## General idea ![](images/icon_salute.gif)

## Available lifts

The following lifts are available in Manopt:

* 
* 
* 

They can be used to optimize over several nonsmooth sets, as listed in the next few sections with further explanations.

## Hadamard (entrywise product)

## Burer-Monteiro for smooth SDP

## Burer-Monteiro for general bounded-rank

## Boxes

## Balls


## What is in a lift structure

## Side comments

The `desingularizationfactory` encode the geometry of a Riemannian manifold, but `egrad2rgrad` and `ehess2rhess` in that factory actually correspond to a lift, as described in the documentation of the factory.
