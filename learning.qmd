The documentation on this website is meant to help users get to grips with Manopt.
Underneath the software, there is a fair amount of math.
This page provides some pointers to learn that math.

<!--
On a *different page* have an FAQ of sorts, maybe a "How to" page: include a section about computing gradients / Hessians, etc. Point to it from other places in the docs.

### Books

The following books (both available online for free) can be helpful to learn the relevant mathematics:

### A full course

* [MATH-512 at EPFL](https://www.nicolasboumal.net/book/#lectures): this is a full set of **video lectures**, slides and exercises (with hints and solutions).
* [edX course](https://www.edx.org/learn/math/ecole-polytechnique-federale-de-lausanne-introduction-to-optimization-on-smooth-manifolds-first-order-methods): this covers the first six weeks of MATH-512, on the edX platform.

### Tutorial videos

* One of the [SIAM Optimization 2023 minitutorials](https://www.nicolasboumal.net/SIAMOP2023/) was about Riemannian optimization.

  - It introduce the basics of differential geometry and Riemannian geometry for optimization on smooth manifolds.
  - The two lectures of 90 minutes each are available as [video 1](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/54629/sections/62408/video_presentations/262676) and [video 2](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/54629/sections/62410/video_presentations/262678).
  - Here are the [slides](https://www.nicolasboumal.net/SIAMOP2023/Tutorial%20SIAM%20Optimization%202023.pdf) and also the [Max-Cut example code](https://www.nicolasboumal.net/SIAMOP2023/manopt_maxcut_example.zip).

* Earlier (and more condensed) versions of that tutorial are available as:

  - A [one-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjaoZE0GBpg&ab_channel=SimonsInstitute) (Simons Institute) and
  - A [two-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK62DwSIjXA&t=6s&ab_channel=FMGDataDrivenControlSummerSchool) (ETHZ/EPFL summer school).
  
* Week 5 of MATH-512 includes a lecture about Manopt: [the basics](https://mediaspace.epfl.ch/media/0_g5gfi47b) and [a bit more](https://mediaspace.epfl.ch/media/0_3a1jnw74).

### Blogs and blog posts

* The [Race to the bottom](https://www.racetothebottom.xyz) blog about nonconvex optimization features some Riemannian optimization.
* This [blog post](https://afonsobandeira.wordpress.com/2015/03/16/optimizing-in-smooth-waters-optimization-on-manifolds/) gives an informal overview of optimization on manifolds.

### Code examples

* See the [examples](https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/tree/master/examples) that ship with Manopt.
