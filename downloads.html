                <ul>
                  <li><strong>New counters system: especially useful to keep
                      track of cost/grad/hess calls</strong>, and also of other
                    important computations inside of (and possibly shared among)
                    those. See <a href="https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/core/incrementcounter.m"
                      target="_blank">incrementcounter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/tools/statscounters.m"
                      target="_blank">statscounter</a> and the example <a href="https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/examples/using_counters.m"
                      target="_blank"> using_counters</a>. As also shown in that
                    example, the <code>problem.stopfun</code> handle for
                    stopping criteria can access the counters, making it
                    possible to stop for more sophisticated reasons than before.</li>
                  <li><strong>The value of the cost function is now always
                      cached</strong>. This leads to significant speed-ups in
                    algorithms which use a line-search that evaluates the cost
                    function (steepestdescent, conjugategradient,
                    barzilaiborwein, rlbfgs included.)</li>
                  <li><strong>The Riemannian gradient and Euclidean gradient are
                      now cached by default.</strong> This is made practical by
                    the new remove() functionalities of StoreDB (see below).
                    This should be particularly useful for algorithms which use
                    finite difference approximations of the Hessian, and when
                    the user supplies a Euclidean Hessian (which, to be
                    converted to Riemannian Hessian, requires the Euclidean
                    gradient). This caching happens regardless of the user's own
                    caching efforts, which should make the overall system easier
                    to understand, as compared to previous versions of Manopt.</li>
                  <li>Core changes to <a href="https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/manopt/core/StoreDB.m"
                      target="_blank">StoreDB</a>. Essentially two changes: (1)
                    purge() now purges based on latest access time (access =
                    read or write) rather than latest write time. (2) Added
                    functions remove() and removefirstifdifferent(), which makes
                    it possible for solvers and line-search algorithms to tell
                    the StoreDB when a certain store is no longer relevant. For
                    solvers that use the new remove() capabilities, <strong>purge()
                      and storedepth have now very little importance</strong>.
                    Furthermore, access is now more protected, with warnings
                    issued if improper keys are accessed; this should make it
                    easier to debug new solvers, and it already makes it
                    possible to cache far fewer points. This rationalizes the
                    choice of caching more things for points that matter
                    (including cost and gradient). Line-search algorithms and
                    all important solvers now use this system.</li>
                  <li><strong>Added support for GPU</strong>. The following
                    manifolds can now manipulate points and tangent vectors
                    directly on the GPU, sometimes leading to huge speed-ups:
                    spherefactory, complexcirclefactory, stiefelfactory,
                    grassmannfactory; see the new example <a href="https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt/blob/master/examples/using_gpu.m"

                    we call M.exp(), it used to generate a warning (then proceed

                    of warnings when calling checkgradient or checkhessian. The
                    warnings have been removed, as this concerns many manifolds:
                    it makes sense to check on a case-by-case basis if the
                    exponential is available for a given manifold.</li>

                    with the tool smallestinconvexhull, is an important step
                    toward integrating nonsmooth solvers in Manopt. See

                <li>Bugs caught</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Logic bug in linesearch: lsmem handling corrected thanks
                    to Wen Huang. The default line-search algorithm for steepest
                    descent should now be much faster.</li>
                  <li>Logic bug in getGradient when using problem.grad with a
                    different number of inputs compared to problem.cost.</li>
                  <li>Corrected logic in plotting step of example
                    low_rank_dist_completion</li>
                  <li>obliquefactory, in transposed mode, had an incorrect M.log</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Modifications to core engine</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added capability to obtain a partial gradient (Euclidean
                    or Riemannian) of a cost function by specifying
                    problem.partialgrad or problem.partialegrad coupled with
                    problem.ncostterms. This is an important step to simplify
                    the future addition of stochastic gradient methods. Use
                    cases are: if problem.cost is expressed as a sum of
                    problem.ncostterms terms, then problem.partialgrad accepts a
                    point x and an index set <samp>sample</samp> so that only
                    the gradient with respect to terms indexed in <samp>sample</samp>
                    is computed and returned.</li>
                  <li>Added possibility to define problem.approxgrad, to provide
                    an approximation of the gradient. This can be populated with
                    a generic gradient approximation based on finite differences
                    via approxgradientFD. Solvers do this by default if they
                    need a gradient and none is given. This feature is slow, but
                    may be useful for prototyping. It is slow because Manopt
                    generates an orthonormal basis of the tangent space, and
                    compute a finite difference approximation of the directional
                    derivative along each basis vector to get an approximate
                    gradient (see also next item and new example
                    thomson_problem.)</li>
                  <li>getGradient now knows how to compute the gradient if the
                    directional derivatives are accessible. This involves
                    generating an orthonormal basis of the tangent space at the
                    current point, then evaluating the directional derivative
                    along each basis vector and taking the appropriate linear
                    combination. This is very slow, especially for high
                    dimensional manifolds.</li>

                <li>New tools</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>lincomb for a generic way of computing a long linear
                    combination of tangent vectors.</li>
                  <li>grammatrix to compute the Gram matrix of a collection of

                  <li>tangentorthobasis to obtain a random orthonormal basis of
                    a tangent space, generically.</li>
                  <li>smallestinconvexhull to compute the smallest tangent
                    vector in the convex hull of a given collection of tangent
                    vectors.</li>
                  <li>hessianmatrix to get a matrix representing the Hessian at
                    a point in an orthonormal tangent basis.</li>
                  <li>checkretraction allows, for manifolds which have a correct
                    exponential implemented, to verify the order of agreement
                    between the retraction and the exponential, in order to
                    determine numerically if the retraction is first- or
                    second-order.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>New examples</li>

                  <li>elliptope_SDP solves SDP's over positive semidefinite
                    matrices with diagonal of 1's. This should run faster than
                    the Max-Cut example for quite a few things.</li>
                  <li>elliptope_SDP_complex, same as above for complex matrices.
                    This solves the SDP which appears in PhaseCut and phase
                    synchronization, for example.</li>
                  <li>thomson_problem to illustrate the new features that allow
                    to not specify the gradient of the cost (slow, but good for
                    prototyping.)</li>

                <li>Modifications to previous behavior</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>symfixedrankYYcomplexfactory now has a Riemannian metric
                    matching that of euclideanfactory (it was scaled down by 2
                    as compared to previous Manopt versions.) This makes it
                    easier to switch between those two geometries. Relevant
                    changes propagated to radio_interferometric_calibration.</li>
                  <li>hessianextreme now returns the info structure returned by
                    the internal solver call. The helper tool
                    tangentspherefactory now incorporates extra projections to
                    ensure the vector returned by hessianextreme is indeed a
                    tangent vector (former version could suffer from numerical
                    drift.)</li>
                  <li>At the end of generalized_eigenvalue_computation, added a
                    rotation of Xsol to match the definition of generalized
                    eigenvectors (the eigenvalues were fine.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Numerous minor improvements; highlights:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>rotationsfactory now has a function M.retr2 which is a
                    second-order retraction.</li>
                  <li>spherefactory and related sphere geometries now have a
                    distance function M.dist which is orders of magnitude more
                    accurate for close-by points.</li>
                  <li>neldermead now respects options.verbosity &lt; 2.</li>
                  <li>plotprofile / surfprofile have now mostly optional inputs,
                    making them easier to call for a quick glimpse at the cost
                    function.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Revamped the internal hashing system used for caching: <em>Manopt
                    no longer uses hashing</em>, which leads to speed-ups and
                  cleaner internal code. Solvers need to be adapted
                  consequently, to use the StoreDB class.</li>
                <li>The caching system now offers a shared memory, which can be
                  accessed and modified at all points. This can notably be used
                  to count function evaluations, or to produce Hessian
                  approximations which require previous iterations memory (such
                  as BFGS for example).</li>
                <li>Because of the new class StoreDB, <em>Octave compatibility
                    is unfortunately compromised</em> until Octave supports
                  Matlab's classdef object oriented programming.</li>

                    model cost; an (innocuous) logic bug was corrected there.

                  <li>In case rho evaluates to NaN (which really should not
                    happen), the code now ensures that the step is rejected and
                    the radius decreased, thus preventing stagnation. In an
                    adversely crafted example, this helped the solver escape the
                    region where NaN's appear (again, this is not supposed to
                    happen, but it's good to handle it nonetheless).</li>

                  tool, ... This revision was executed with the precious and
                  frequent help of Bart Vandereycken, who first described this
                  geometry in a <a target="_blank" href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/110845768">paper</a>.</li>
                <li>All solvers now also return the <code>options</code>
                  structure, to make it easier to investigate what options a
                  solver uses and what their default values are.</li>
                <li>It is now possible to specify a line-search hint function in
                  the <code>problem</code> structure; the result of that
                  function will be used as a first guess in an Armijo

                  This is very useful if, for a given problem, you are able to
                  make a good guess at how far along the search line one should
                  look. It is much easier this way than with the previous way,
                  which required implementing a whole new line-search algorithm.</li>

                  at all), the truncated-CG algorithm now explicitly checks that
                  the model cost decreases with (inner) iterations. If an
                  increase is witnessed (which is bad), tCG now returns the best

              <ul>
                <li>Many files are now better commented and documented. In
                  particular, the solvers now have quite complete documentation
                  in code, available using Matlab's help command.</li>
                <li>The trust region solver was modified substantially. The
                  algorithm is now slightly different from the previous
                  versions, but is cleaner in its handling of errors, and
                  behaves almost the same as before for normal operations. In
                  particular, the fine-convergence heuristic has been changed to
                  match a standard heuristic from the literature (see in code
                  for references and the relevant option). The <a href="solver_documentation_trustregions.html">online
                    documentation</a> was extended as well. The original trust
                  region radius (Delta0 and Delta_bar) are now interpreted
                  correctly. Their values are different from earlier Manopt
                  versions as a result. if you get a lot of TR+ or TR- for the
                  first few iterations, you may want to tweak those options.</li>

                <li>Line search algorithms have been heavily modified. The basic
                  line search for example is now invariant under shifting and
                  rescaling of the cost function, and the built-in line search
                  algorithms now accept options too. Line searches now do not
                  expect to be given a normalized search direction anymore, and
                  they can decide whether to use the norm as supplemental
                  information or to be unaffected by it. For example, the
                  default line search for the conjugate gradient solver (the
                  adaptive line search) is not invariant to the norm of the
                  search direction.</li>
