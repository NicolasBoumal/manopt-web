                <ul>
                  <li>Limited-memory BFGS: a Riemannian version of the
                    quasi-Newton solver, implemented by Changshuo Liu based on
                    work by Wen Huang et al.</li>
                  <li>barzilaiborwein: a gradient method with step-size
                    selection based on a Barzilai-Borwein heuristic and
                    line-search, contributed by Margherita Porcelli and Bruno
                    Iannazzo.</li>
                  <li>stochasticgradient: stochastic gradient algorithm on
                    manifolds, together with its step-size selection algorithm
                    stepsize_sg and a new example: PCA_stochastic.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>New tools</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>tangent2vec: given a tangent vector and an orthogonal
                    basis on the corresponding tangent space, returns the
                    coordinates of the vector in that basis.</li>
                  <li>criticalpointfinder: allows to find critical points of an
                    optimization problem (useful to study saddle points of a
                    non-convex problem for example.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>New geometries</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>realphasefactory: to optimize over vectors with
                    unit-modulus complex entries (phases) with symmetries such
                    that they could be the phases of the DFT (fft) of a real
                    vector.</li>

                <li>Modifications to core engine</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added the capacity to provide a subgradient in a problem
                    description, and to call for it in a solver. This, together
                    with the tool smallestinconvexhull, is an important step
                    toward integrating nonsmooth solvers in Manopt. See
                    canGetSubgradient and getSubgradient. Define with
                    problem.subgrad(x, tol), where x is a point on a manifold
                    problem.M and tol (nonnegative) is a tolerance in computing
                    the subgradient (0 by default).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Bug fixes</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>tangentspacefactory now has correct tangent, egrad2rgrad
                    and ehess2rhess tools, including projections (thanks to a
                    comment by Jesus Briales on the forum.)</li>
                  <li>For Euclidean manifolds, M.tangent functions were changed
                    from identity to M.proj.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Smaller things</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>sympositivedefinitefactory now has a cheaper yet
                    second-order retraction, as suggested by Wen Huang.</li>
                  <li>euclideancomplexfactory now also handles multidimensional
                    arrays, just like its real counterpart.</li>
                  <li>smallestinconvexhull tool now accepts a tolerance as
                    optional input.</li>
                  <li>Further improved accuracy of distance function
                    computations in all sphere / oblique manifolds with asin
                    function instead of acos without branching, following
                    discussions with Bruno Iannazzo and P.-A. Absil.</li>
                  <li>Two new options for linesearch_hint: allows to disable
                    backtracking and allows to disable forcing of a
                    non-increasing cost.</li>
                  <li>fixedrankembeddedfactory now has an orthographic
                    retraction provided by Teng Zhang as M.retr_ortho.</li>
                  <li>Many, many smaller improvements to code and documentation</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li><a href="downloads/Manopt_3.0.zip">Manopt 3.0</a>, packaged
                November 12, 2016.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Code moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt">GitHub</a>!
                  Now accepting pull requests, and accelerating distribution of
                  patches.</li>
                <li>Bugs caught</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Logic bug in linesearch: lsmem handling corrected thanks
                    to Wen Huang. The default line-search algorithm for steepest
                    descent should now be much faster.</li>
                  <li>Logic bug in getGradient when using problem.grad with a
                    different number of inputs compared to problem.cost.</li>
                  <li>Corrected logic in plotting step of example
                    low_rank_dist_completion</li>
                  <li>obliquefactory, in transposed mode, had an incorrect M.log</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Modifications to core engine</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added capability to obtain a partial gradient (Euclidean
                    or Riemannian) of a cost function by specifying
                    problem.partialgrad or problem.partialegrad coupled with
                    problem.ncostterms. This is an important step to simplify
                    the future addition of stochastic gradient methods. Use
                    cases are: if problem.cost is expressed as a sum of
                    problem.ncostterms terms, then problem.partialgrad accepts a
                    point x and an index set <samp>sample</samp> so that only
                    the gradient with respect to terms indexed in <samp>sample</samp>
                    is computed and returned.</li>
                  <li>Added possibility to define problem.approxgrad, to provide
                    an approximation of the gradient. This can be populated with
                    a generic gradient approximation based on finite differences
                    via approxgradientFD. Solvers do this by default if they
                    need a gradient and none is given. This feature is slow, but
                    may be useful for prototyping. It is slow because Manopt
                    generates an orthonormal basis of the tangent space, and
                    compute a finite difference approximation of the directional
                    derivative along each basis vector to get an approximate
                    gradient (see also next item and new example
                    thomson_problem.)</li>
                  <li>getGradient now knows how to compute the gradient if the
                    directional derivatives are accessible. This involves
                    generating an orthonormal basis of the tangent space at the
                    current point, then evaluating the directional derivative
                    along each basis vector and taking the appropriate linear
                    combination. This is very slow, especially for high
                    dimensional manifolds.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>New tools</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>lincomb for a generic way of computing a long linear
                    combination of tangent vectors.</li>
                  <li>grammatrix to compute the Gram matrix of a collection of
                    tangent vectors.</li>
                  <li>orthogonalize to orthogonalize a basis of tangent vectors.</li>
                  <li>tangentorthobasis to obtain a random orthonormal basis of
                    a tangent space, generically.</li>
                  <li>smallestinconvexhull to compute the smallest tangent
                    vector in the convex hull of a given collection of tangent
                    vectors.</li>
                  <li>hessianmatrix to get a matrix representing the Hessian at
                    a point in an orthonormal tangent basis.</li>
                  <li>checkretraction allows, for manifolds which have a correct
                    exponential implemented, to verify the order of agreement
                    between the retraction and the exponential, in order to
                    determine numerically if the retraction is first- or
                    second-order.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>New examples</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>elliptope_SDP solves SDP's over positive semidefinite
                    matrices with diagonal of 1's. This should run faster than
                    the Max-Cut example for quite a few things.</li>
                  <li>elliptope_SDP_complex, same as above for complex matrices.
                    This solves the SDP which appears in PhaseCut and phase
                    synchronization, for example.</li>
                  <li>thomson_problem to illustrate the new features that allow
                    to not specify the gradient of the cost (slow, but good for
                    prototyping.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>New geometries</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>skewsymmetricfactory for skew-symmetric matrices
                    (Euclidean geometry)</li>
                  <li>obliquecomplexfactory, to work with complex matrices whose
                    columns (or rows) all have unit norm</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Modifications to previous behavior</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>symfixedrankYYcomplexfactory now has a Riemannian metric
                    matching that of euclideanfactory (it was scaled down by 2
                    as compared to previous Manopt versions.) This makes it
                    easier to switch between those two geometries. Relevant
                    changes propagated to radio_interferometric_calibration.</li>
                  <li>hessianextreme now returns the info structure returned by
                    the internal solver call. The helper tool
                    tangentspherefactory now incorporates extra projections to
                    ensure the vector returned by hessianextreme is indeed a
                    tangent vector (former version could suffer from numerical
                    drift.)</li>
                  <li>At the end of generalized_eigenvalue_computation, added a
                    rotation of Xsol to match the definition of generalized
                    eigenvectors (the eigenvalues were fine.)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Numerous minor improvements; highlights:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>rotationsfactory now has a function M.retr2 which is a
                    second-order retraction.</li>
                  <li>spherefactory and related sphere geometries now have a
                    distance function M.dist which is orders of magnitude more
                    accurate for close-by points.</li>
                  <li>neldermead now respects options.verbosity &lt; 2.</li>
                  <li>plotprofile / surfprofile have now mostly optional inputs,
                    making them easier to call for a quick glimpse at the cost
                    function.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <li><a href="downloads/Manopt_2.0.zip">Manopt 2.0</a>, packaged
                July 6, 2015.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Revamped the internal hashing system used for caching: <em>Manopt
                    no longer uses hashing</em>, which leads to speed-ups and
                  cleaner internal code. Solvers need to be adapted

                <li>The caching system now offers a shared memory, which can be
                  accessed and modified at all points. This can notably be used
                  to count function evaluations, or to produce Hessian
                  approximations which require previous iterations memory (such
                  as BFGS for example).</li>

                    is unfortunately compromised</em> until Octave supports

                  <li><code>statsfunhelper</code>, to ease the use of <code>options.statsfun</code>,
                    which allows recording custom statistics at each iteration
                    during optimization. See the tutorial.</li>

                    used to plot a cost function restricted to a 1D or 2D
                    subspace of a tangent space.</li>
                  <li><code>tangentspherefactory</code> and <code>tangentspacefactory</code>,

                    the tangent space to a manifold at a given point, or a
                    representation of the whole tangent space. Useful to solve

                  <li>As of Manopt 1.0.6, the inner solver tCG monitors the
                    model cost; an (innocuous) logic bug was corrected there.
                    Theory behind this feature is now better understood (a paper
                    reference + BibTex was added).</li>
                  <li>Warns if many TR+ / TR- steps are detected, to suggest
                    changing parameter values.</li>
                  <li>Uses safe version of tic/toc timers (originally because
                    Octave now supports them).</li>
                  <li>In case rho evaluates to NaN (which really should not
                    happen), the code now ensures that the step is rejected and
                    the radius decreased, thus preventing stagnation. In an
                    adversely crafted example, this helped the solver escape the
                    region where NaN's appear (again, this is not supposed to
                    happen, but it's good to handle it nonetheless).</li>

                  tool, ... This revision was executed with the precious and
                  frequent help of Bart Vandereycken, who first described this
                  geometry in a <a target="_blank" href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/110845768">paper</a>.</li>
                <li>All solvers now also return the <code>options</code>
                  structure, to make it easier to investigate what options a
                  solver uses and what their default values are.</li>
                <li>It is now possible to specify a line-search hint function in
                  the <code>problem</code> structure; the result of that
                  function will be used as a first guess in an Armijo

                  This is very useful if, for a given problem, you are able to
                  make a good guess at how far along the search line one should
                  look. It is much easier this way than with the previous way,
                  which required implementing a whole new line-search algorithm.</li>

                  at all), the truncated-CG algorithm now explicitly checks that
                  the model cost decreases with (inner) iterations. If an
                  increase is witnessed (which is bad), tCG now returns the best

                <li>Many files are now better commented and documented. In

                  versions, but is cleaner in its handling of errors, and
                  behaves almost the same as before for normal operations. In
                  particular, the fine-convergence heuristic has been changed to
                  match a standard heuristic from the literature (see in code
                  for references and the relevant option). The <a href="solver_documentation_trustregions.html">online
                    documentation</a> was extended as well. The original trust
                  region radius (Delta0 and Delta_bar) are now interpreted
                  correctly. Their values are different from earlier Manopt
                  versions as a result. if you get a lot of TR+ or TR- for the

                <li>Line search algorithms have been heavily modified. The basic
                  line search for example is now invariant under shifting and
                  rescaling of the cost function, and the built-in line search
                  algorithms now accept options too. Line searches now do not
                  expect to be given a normalized search direction anymore, and
                  they can decide whether to use the norm as supplemental
                  information or to be unaffected by it. For example, the
                  default line search for the conjugate gradient solver (the
                  adaptive line search) is not invariant to the norm of the
                  search direction.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>This release is a first step toward compatibility with
                  Octave. We're not there yet, but in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">examples</span>
                  folder, you will find <span style="font-family: monospace;">maxcut_octave.m</span>
                  (removed in 1.0.8), which should run in Octave 3.6.4. In
                  there, more info about compatibility issues and limitations
                  are provided.</li>
                <li>Manopt is not organized in a Matlab package anymore (so
                  folders are called <span style="font-family: monospace;">folder</span>
                  and not <span style="font-family: monospace;">+folder</span>):
                  <strong>no <code>import</code>'s anymore</strong>. Simply
                  call <code>importmanopt</code> to add all Manopt functions to
                  the path, once.</li>
                <li>Sign error in right hand side of Lyapunov equation in <code>
                    elliptopefactory.projection</code> corrected.<br>

                <li>The new <span style="font-family: monospace;">/manopt/examples</span>
                  directory now contains documented examples.</li>
                <li>Added manifolds spectrahedron and elliptope, for symmetric
                  positive semidefinite fixed-rank matrices with constraints on
                  the diagonal or the trace. Notably useful for max-cut like SDP
                  relaxations (see examples) and correlation matrix
                  approximation / completion etc.</li>
                <li>The Riemannian gradient and Hessian may be given via their
                  Euclidean counterparts, using <code>problem.egrad</code> and
                  <code>problem.ehess</code>.</li>
                <li>Improved <code>checkgradient</code> and <code>checkhessian</code>
                  tools.</li>
                <li>Added Riemannian log map for the Grassmann manifold.</li>
                <li>Made <code>egrad2rgrad</code> and <code>ehess2rhess</code>
                  available in more geometries.</li>
                <li>Added the tool <code>hessianspectrum</code> to compute the
                  eigenvalues of the Hessian (w/ or w/o preconditioner).</li>
                <li>Added notions of <code>tangent</code> and <code>tangent2ambient</code>
                  to manifolds.</li>
                <li>Added notions of <code>vec</code> and <code>mat</code> for
                  manifolds, to represent tangent vectors as column vectors.<br>
